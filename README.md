# Investigator Generation - Call of Cthulhu (6th Edition)

This tool is intended to simplify the creation of Investigators for the
*Call of Cthulhu* roleplaying game.

This is a refactor of a [previous version](https://github.com/sulonen/
CoC-Legacy). My intent with this project is to provide some basic
persistence and to generalize the backend so that it can support similar
efforts for other RPG platforms.

Chaosium very generously allows users of their material to make stuff
like this and share it without any fuss. That being said, here's the
standard legal thing:

>  No revenue is being generated by or from this project.
>  *Call of Cthulhu* and *Basic Roleplaying* are Registered
>  Trademarks of Chaosium Inc, and are used with their permission.
>
>  Chaosium Inc is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc.
